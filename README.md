# Introduction

Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) refers to the tight conjoining of and coordination between computational and physical resources. Some of the CPSs are smart grid, autonomous automobile systems, medical monitoring, process control systems, robotics systems, and automatic pilot avionics. CPSs will be deployed for decades, thus they should be secure against malicious cyberattacks. Quantum cryptography is one of the emerging topics in the field of the computer industry. Quantum Computers have made it easier to crack existing cryptography techniques. Rather than depending on the complexity of factoring large numbers, quantum cryptography is based on the fundamental and unchanging principles of quantum mechanics. Thus, on this project we will try to apply Quantum cryptography on the Cyber-physical systems in order to make them more secure.
